      <p>On November 27, 2024 - E-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN.O), opens new tab has developed new generative artificial intelligence (AI) that can process images and videos in addition to text, making it less reliant on AI startup Anthropic, The Information reported on Wednesday.
The development of the new AI model will help Amazon reduce its reliance on Anthropic's Claude chatbot, a popular offering on Amazon Web Services (AWS), the report said, citing two people with knowledge of the matter. 
The new large language model (LLM), code-named Olympus, will be able to understand scenes in images and videos and help customers search for specific scenes, such as a winning basketball shot, using simple text prompts, according to the report.
Last week, Amazon invested an additional $4 billion into OpenAI competitor Anthropic, mirroring a $4 billion investment made last year in September to capitalize on generative AI technology.</p>

      <p>The project leverages a modern tech stack to deliver a seamless user experience and efficient data handling. The frontend is built using React, enabling a dynamic and responsive user interface with reusable components for chart visualization and interactivity. On the backend, Node.js powers the server, providing robust and scalable APIs to manage data flow between the frontend and the database. The data for the charts is stored in a MySQL database, which ensures reliable and structured storage for managing generative AI-related metrics. The integration of these technologies forms a cohesive infrastructure, enabling smooth communication between the client and server while maintaining data consistency and performance. This setup ensures scalability, flexibility, and an efficient workflow for visualizing and managing analytics.</p>
